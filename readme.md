Hello! Welcome to my Project 3. This project centers around building out an interactive form with pure Javascript. This form should let the user register for this hypothetical conference where they need to input their name, email, the size/type/color shirt they want, what conference events they wish to attend, and their payment information to pay for these events. Then, I have build out ways to validate each of these fields. Also since I am not actually submitting the form details anywhere, upon clicking 'Register', the page will just clear and refresh (as long as all the fields are valid).

Thanks!
